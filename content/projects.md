# Project 1

Make a recording of at least two minutes with one performer and one microphone. Have your mic choice and position be informed by what we have been experimenting with in class so far. Include a paragraph stating your chosen mic and position. How far away was the microphone and what part of the instrument was it pointed at? Describe why you chose this mic and position in terms of sound recording. Instead of saying "I liked this better", say something like "this was brighter and more clear, which is a sound I prefer".

Make sure the recording is made with appropriate levels, somewhere around -10 dB.

# Project 3
