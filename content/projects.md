# Project 1

Make a recording of at least two minutes with one performer and one microphone. Have your mic choice and position be informed by what we have been experimenting with in class so far. Include a paragraph stating your chosen mic and position. How far away was the microphone and what part of the instrument was it pointed at? Describe why you chose this mic and position in terms of sound recording. Instead of saying "I liked this better", say something like "this was brighter and more clear, which is a sound I prefer".

Make sure the recording is made with appropriate levels, somewhere around -10 dB.

# Project 2

Use the same requirements from the first project, but now with multiple mics on one performer. Include a paragraph stating your chosen mics and position. **Include a picture of your mic setup.** Describe why you chose this mic and position in terms of sound recording.

Pick your favorite multi-mic technique that we've gone over in class. See [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6Fann2gMSs) for a review on stereo mic setups. Remember, you can also use mixed microphone types (small and large diaphragm condensers) to pickup the unique qualities of different parts of the instrument.

# Project 3

Make a recording with 2 or more performers

# Project 4 - Final project
